# My Contact Book
--
[Live application can be found here]()

This is a command-line-interface application designed to allow the user to access their contacts book, retrieve specific contact information, edit/delete exisiting contacts & add new contact information. This project has been designed for educational purposes.

## UX
To begin planning this project I started first with UX, designing the logic of the programme based upon the user stories. As this is a command-line application there is no design featured as HTML & CSS have not been used.

### Strategy
User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to easily access all of my contacts at once.
- As a user, I want to be able to retrieve a contact's information based upon their name.
- As a user, I want to update an existing contact's information if there has been a change.
- As a user, I want to be able to download contact information by group (family/friends).
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a contact entry.

### Structure
![Flowchart of Python logic](assets/images/flowchart.png)

As you can see from the flowchart above the logic has been based around the four key user options, retrieving contacts, adding contacts & editing existing contacts. Each path will take the user back to the beginning once finished.
